This repository has the revised solution of the Bollywood data analysis problem statement, where I've analysed the gender bias in the movie posters and scripts Using LLM LLaVA model.
Application maintanance: No fine tuning of the model, the model is good for image and text analysis. Instructed to analyse the data to analyse gender bias in the movie.
